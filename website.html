      <p>Hi! My name is Kartiki Sharma and I am passionate
        about Design and Technology. For this reason, I am continually
        seeking for more knowledge and developing my skills in Web & App
        Development.
        
        Currently, I am studying Computer Science (Honours, Co-op) at the 
        University of Waterloo. I enjoy learning about new technologies, 
        especially those that can help me improve my life and provide me a 
        creative outlet.
        
        In my spare time, I like to try various art mediums, travel, and 
        improve my French skills. I also like working with children and 
        taking on volunteer tasks which educate and encourage them to 
        pursue their interests.
